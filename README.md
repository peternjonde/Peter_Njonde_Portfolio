# [Weather App (SwiftUI)](https://github.com/peternjonde/Weather_APP)
* An application which uses an Api found online to show the weather of your location 
* Used CLLocationManger to prompt the user when they open the app to let us use their location
* With the information from the json file, I implemented the weather on the UI with a nice aesthetic
*  Note that this app is not on the app store but was just made for practice

# [Egg Catcher (Python)](https://github.com/peternjonde/Egg-catcher)
* Used pygame to create a canvas and to create ovals(eggs) that would drop from the top of the canvas, and you would lose a life if the egg touches the bottom of the canvas 
* Used and half cycle for my catcher and was able to move it using x co-ordinate and y co-ordinate and when the egg hit the catcher you gained points
