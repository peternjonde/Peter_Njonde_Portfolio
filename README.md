# [Bezier Fine Line Tool (html/javaScript)](https://github.com/peternjonde/LineTool)
* Pen Tool created with OpenGL(using Glew) which allows user to create dots but each time a dot is created a Bezier spine line is created between the last point and the new one. The points and control point can be moved which will alter the spine line
* Each point is contained in a dynamic array, which is of the type of a struct which holds all the information about the node like its location
* Uses GLFW_MOUSE_BUTTON to get uses mouse interaction
* Uses glfwGetCursorPos to get the position of the cursor to determine where the buttons should go  and uses glVertex2f to put the lines on the screen 
* Uses Bezier curve equation to find points on the curve line then render each point as a line segment to create lines
